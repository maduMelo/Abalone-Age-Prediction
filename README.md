# Intelligent Systems Project - Abalone Age Prediction

This repository contains the code and files related to the Intelligent Systems (IS) class project ministered by the Computer Science department at the Federal University of Pernambuco on the 2024.1 semester. The main objective of the project is to explore the efficiency of four Machine Learning algorithms in a simple regression problem to predict the age of abalone molluscs.

## Project Content
- **Data Loading and Processing:** Utilization of Pandas for data manipulation, OneHotEncoder, and StandardScaler for data preparation.
- **Algorithm Analysis:** Four algorithms were analyzed using the No-Code Orange software to determine which one would have the best performance for subsequent implementation.
- **Model Definition:** Implementation of an Artificial Neural Network with dense layers and ReLU activation function on the Google Colab platform using the language Python.
- **Results:** Analysis of the obtained results with graphical visualizations and performance metrics.

## Dataset Details
- **Instances:** 4177
- **Attributes:** 1 categorical (gender), 1 integer (number of rings), and 7 continuous (width, diameter, height, total weight, shucked weight, viscera weight, shell weight).

## Algorithms Tested
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Decision Tree
- Artificial Neural Networks (RNN)
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)

## Technologies Used
- **Data Analysis:** Orange Data Mining Toolbox
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Data Manipulation:** Pandas, NumPy
- **Machine Learning:** Keras
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib
- **Dataset Source:** UCI Machine Learning Repository

## Results
The Neural Network model demonstrated superior performance in predicting the age of abalones, with lower error rates and good explained variance in both training and test data.
